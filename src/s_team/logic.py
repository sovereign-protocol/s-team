"""Agreement documents and their consent-based organizational hierarchy.

Every agreement remains an independently shared topic.  A subagreement is an
Agreement holding a role in its parent: the parent carries an ordinary role
offered to an Agreement actor, and the child carries an
``agreement_role_holding`` naming which role in which parent.  Consequently,
accepting a parent never grants access to its children, and a hierarchy is
visible only once the seat has been taken on both sides.
